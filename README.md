## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - All-in-one web framework for building fast, content-focused websites.

### What I learned

This was my first time doing a challenge like this and using pure CSS to style a complete website. Although I had learned CSS before, I always used component libraries or frameworks like Chakra UI or TailwindCSS. Therefore, I faced some challenges with CSS structure and organization. For example, I learned how to set up a basic frame from Kevin Powellâ€™s version of this challenge. I also adopted the BEM methodology for writing CSS in a consistent way.

Another challenge was adjusting the site to different screen sizes while matching the figma mockup as closely as possible. I had to rediscover CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts for this purpose. Working with a figma file was a nice experience, but I noticed some details that were not clear in the design system, such as font size differences and letter spacing across screen sizes.

### Useful resources

- [Get BEM](https://getbem.com/) - This helped me adopt the BEM methodology.
- [Kevin Powell's take on this challenge](https://scrimba.com/learn/spacetravel) - I learned a lot from this course, especially the way he structures his CSS foundation.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`          | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `npm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`      | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`    | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |
